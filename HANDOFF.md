# HANDOFF — workout logging usability sprint

Updated 2026-07-29. Nothing is in flight. **5 commits are local and unpushed.**

## Push this first

```
9e2213c Rebuild set entry: one Done button, empty fields, labelled columns
c5b98e4 Clear the search query instead of tapping Cancel (#96)
e73c8fe Stop three failures from reporting success (#86)
03fdd10 Wire up PR detection, and normalise stats to kilograms
07aa630 Fix #96: query searchFields, and actually assert filtering
```

`#96`, `#84` and `#89` were closed manually, because the `Closes` trailers
cannot fire until these are pushed.

## The test baseline changed — read this before judging any run

**`xcodebuild test` now exits 0.** 671 Swift Testing pass, zero XCUITest
failures, verified on iPhone 13 Pro Max / iOS 26.5.

This supersedes the long-standing note that exit 65 is expected. #96 is fixed,
so **a non-zero exit is now a real regression** — do not dismiss one as "the
known four". The other traps still hold: never pipe `xcodebuild` through `tail`
without `set -o pipefail`, and remember XCUITest failures print
`Test Case '-[...]' failed`, not Swift Testing's `✘`.

## What shipped

Installed to Evan's iPhone 2026-07-29 ~21:30, from `9e2213c`.

Four gym-session complaints, and what actually caused each:

| Complaint | Cause |
|---|---|
| Many "Done" buttons, none working | `ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard)` declared **inside** `SetRowView`, so every visible row contributed one to the same keyboard region, each clearing only its own `private @FocusState` |
| `0` in every weight box; typing 40 gave `040` | `Binding<Double>` with `set.weight ?? 0` — nil rendered as the literal string `0`, and the `"0"` prompt was dead code. The model (`Double?`) and ViewModel already accepted nil; **only the view erased it** |
| Can't tell weight from reps | No column headers; no `accessibilityLabel` on either field |
| Timer blocked the screen | ~200pt opaque card in a `ZStack` over a scroll view reserving only `.padding(.bottom, 80)` |

Now: one screen-level `@FocusState` keyed on exercise+set UUID with a single
keyboard accessory bar (prev/next/Done); `Binding<Double?>` via the optional
`TextField` overload, so nil renders empty with the previous session as a grey
prompt; select-all on focus so editing `40` to `45` no longer yields `4045`; a
`Grid` with SET/PREVIOUS/WEIGHT/REPS headers, ≥44pt targets and a stacked
`LabeledContent` layout at accessibility type sizes; and the rest timer as a
compact `safeAreaInset` bar backed by a **screen-owned** `RestTimerSession`.

Also fixed while in these files: `removeSet` left numbering gaps (Set 1, Set 3);
a second tap on ✓ silently rewrote `completedAt` and restarted the timer (now
un-completes); accessibility identifiers collided across exercises, which is why
the UI tests needed `firstMatch`.

## Ghost adoption was built and deliberately cut — do not re-add naively

The plan called for empty fields that adopt the greyed previous value on ✓.
It was implemented, then removed after adversarial review.

**`WorkoutSet.weight` is `Double?` and nil already means bodyweight.** So
"adopt when nil" cannot distinguish "accept the ghost" from "I meant blank":
previous 80 kg × 8, user wants bodyweight × 12, leaves weight empty → logs
**80 kg × 12**, silently. It also broke `LogSetTool`, which reads model fields
directly and would have logged visible ghosts as `weight=nil, reps=nil`.

Values are pre-written as before. The PREVIOUS column and prompts remain,
**display-only**, so a stale ghost is cosmetic rather than a wrong logged
weight. Revisiting this needs an explicit touched/cleared state or a bodyweight
control — and must be checked against the ChatTools write paths, which bypass
the ViewModel.

## Open follow-ups from this sprint

- **#117** — `WorkoutDetailView.swift:135-144` writes `set.weight` directly to
  the model, bypassing the mutation API, so **history edits never sync**; also
  can't clear a value, and parses with non-locale `Double(String)`. Fix this
  before or with #122, which restyles the same row.
- **#122** — extend the new set-row visual language to History and Home (the
  Phase 3 that was cut).
- **#120** — Coach `end_workout` can't reach the screen-owned `RestTimerSession`,
  so a Coach-ended workout still chimes and stays onscreen.
- **#121** — `persistMutation()` is documented as debounced but has no delay or
  cancellation check.
- **#118** Live Activities · **#119** app-wide accessibility.
- **#86** stays open: only three silent-failure items were taken (insight
  dismissal, photo attach, exercise save). Keychain, auth comparison, Bicep
  outputs and stale docs are untouched.

## Gotchas worth keeping

- `.searchable` exposes a **search field** (`app.searchFields`), not a text
  field — that was #96's whole cause. Its **Cancel button is not exposed to
  XCUITest on iOS 26.5**; clear the query instead. And an empty search field
  reports its **placeholder** as `value`, not `""`.
- The **iPhone 13 Pro Max simulator may not exist** and must be created, not
  substituted. iPhone 17 produces a false `ChatCoachTests` failure.
- Prefer `-destination 'platform=iOS,id=676B845C-62CA-52B1-A6DA-1FACF77CAC01'`
  over the device name — CLAUDE.md's string contains a typographic apostrophe
  that a straight quote will not match.
- Static typechecks are not a test run.
